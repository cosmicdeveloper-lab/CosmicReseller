# scripts/create_fb_profile.py

"""
Create and save a persistent Facebook login profile using Playwright.

Usage:
    python create_fb_profile.py

This script:
1. Opens Firefox with a persistent user data directory.
2. Lets the user manually log in to Facebook.
3. Ensures Marketplace is opened once to clear any intro pop-ups.
4. Saves the profile in the `playwright_profile` directory for reuse.
